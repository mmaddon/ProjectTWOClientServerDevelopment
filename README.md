  In the production of completing this project, it required a lot of the code to be given by a trial-and-error form of measurement. There were also times that spacing and indention made a difference in it quality of the result. There were some things that needed to be removed and then reimplemented back into the coding to see if the proper context was used i.e., the reset and the age of the animals.  There were also times that MongoDB was not functioning due Firefox internet error that would not correct itself even after logging out.  However, without MongoDB as the large component of the programâ€™s functioning, one could not do without the other when trying to run the program at hand.  
	In the aspects of the Dash framework, one had to first make sure MongoDB was up and running before implementing the framework.  Then each frame had to be gone through from the beginning one by one for everything to function properly.  If one skipped different parts of the framework, then there were times that they would not function because of it.  
	There was also a time to whereas the project itself in the ProjectTwoDashboard.ipynb had to be split in two to see what problems were not allowing the program to complete itself entirely.  After the difficulty was discovered, the program was able to be put back together and run the program in its entirety.  
	In the end, the biggest problem that unfortunately consumed most of the time was the difficulty that was with Firefox in not being able close itself.  There was continuation of trying to log off and go back in, but the problem kept on presenting itself.  Finally, by going up to the Application bar at the top of the left part of the screen and going down and choosing from the list that said Internet, the screen was able to be brought up and again and all that needed to be done was close off the screens that were open but not presented to be opened.  They were out of time in being active and by closing them, the program was able to work again properly.

By Putting the png for Grazioso Salvare Logo and using the correct html for SNHU CS-340 Dashboard using the correct images, this was the result:

By putting in correct id for filter-radio-button, I was able to set Water, Mountain, and Disaster to see the database.  It is set to start 
at Water when the program first runs:

        Taking notes and recycling code is the best way to keep programs maintainable, readable, and adaptable.  By explaining what is going on during the code, however using layman's terms keeps the confusion for any other user looking at what was completed to a minimum.  In utilizing the CRUD Python module, user/programmers can create tables for viewing and utilizing information in conjunction with updating MongoDB collections and databases.   

        The best way to approach a problem as a computer scientist is utlizing trial and error and recycling from previous projects.  That form of exercise has been the only way that I have been able complete my projects including the project with Grazioso Salvare.  I am going to continue to utilize such forms of exercise because for the moment there just doesn't seem to be any other method.  

        Computer Scientists are for developing information utilizing different arrays through code in order to help companies become more technologically expeditious and provide accurate numerical and word information.  This world is ran by technological information and in order for businesses to succeed the skills and experience of Computer Scientists can keep businesses up-to-date and excel along side other companies.  This work would help companies, such as Grazioso Salvare, be able to examine information and cut other unnecessary information help prioritize things that need attention and other left alone. This form of thinking will help companies continue to grow with less mistakes, such as utilizing unnecessary information.
