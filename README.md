  In the production of completing this project, it required a lot of the code to be given by a trial-and-error form of measurement. There were also times that spacing and indention made a difference in it quality of the result. There were some things that needed to be removed and then reimplemented back into the coding to see if the proper context was used i.e., the reset and the age of the animals.  There were also times that MongoDB was not functioning due Firefox internet error that would not correct itself even after logging out.  However, without MongoDB as the large component of the programâ€™s functioning, one could not do without the other when trying to run the program at hand.  
	In the aspects of the Dash framework, one had to first make sure MongoDB was up and running before implementing the framework.  Then each frame had to be gone through from the beginning one by one for everything to function properly.  If one skipped different parts of the framework, then there were times that they would not function because of it.  
	There was also a time to whereas the project itself in the ProjectTwoDashboard.ipynb had to be split in two to see what problems were not allowing the program to complete itself entirely.  After the difficulty was discovered, the program was able to be put back together and run the program in its entirety.  
	In the end, the biggest problem that unfortunately consumed most of the time was the difficulty that was with Firefox in not being able close itself.  There was continuation of trying to log off and go back in, but the problem kept on presenting itself.  Finally, by going up to the Application bar at the top of the left part of the screen and going down and choosing from the list that said Internet, the screen was able to be brought up and again and all that needed to be done was close off the screens that were open but not presented to be opened.  They were out of time in being active and by closing them, the program was able to work again properly.

By Putting the png for Grazioso Salvare Logo and using the correct html for SNHU CS-340 Dashboard using the correct images, this was the result:

By putting in correct id for filter-radio-button, I was able to set Water, Mountain, and Disaster to see the database.  It is set to start 
at Water when the program first runs:
